Passionate about bleeding-edge technologies to simplify software development and deployment processes. With a background in both development and operations, 
I focus on bridging the gap to accelerate delivery while maintaining reliability and scalability.


I also have a deep love for Free and Open Source Software, believing in the power of community-driven collaboration.
